:::{#hero-heading}

Hi, I’m Chang Su (苏畅 in Chinese).  I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Economics at Colorado State University. My research lies at the intersection of **environmental economics**, **quantitative marketing**, and **sustainability**.  I am particularly interested in **consumer choices toward sustainable products and energy-saving technologies**, as well as **firms’ environmental strategies and marketing behaviors**.  

Specifically, my work focuses on:

- The global energy efficiency gap, and how policies can reduce consumer and firm irrationalities to close this gap.  
- The role of labels and visual signals in shaping consumer behavior.  
- Applying structural models, causal inference, and machine learning methods to analyze consumer behavior and firm strategies, with applications in sustainability, technology, and related markets.  



## Education

- MA in Economics, Colorado State University
